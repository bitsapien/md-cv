## Currently

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer at [eLitmus](https://www.elitmus.com). I take care of multiple applications(both client facing and internal), from conceptualizing features, building them, fixing bugs, to handling their deployments.

## Projects

### eLitmus.com
`2015 - `

The application contains code for both the candidate side and administrator side. I built a bunch of features, fixed bugs, cleansed dirty code(heavy refactoring), sped  up the test suite.

### [Acmesmith](https://github.com/sorah/acmesmith)
`2017`

A ruby gem for automating fetching SSL certificates from ACME supported CAs like Let's Encrypt. This project was originally a CLI tool. Refactored the code such that ruby APIs were made available for easy integration with ruby projects.

### Themis
`2017`
A Rails backend and an Android application for attendance of employees when they are on the event site.

### Faces
`2016`

This application takes care of cropping out photographs and archiving admit cards related to our tests. Ported the application from a local machine to the cloud(AWS). Since, storage is not plenty on the cloud given the nature of the application, wrote a storage driver similar to the "fog" gem to switch storage options(eg: local, s3, azure-storage). This is a Rails application that uses programs like _imagemagick_.

### Chef cookbooks
`2016 - `

Wrote a bunch of cookbooks for deploying our applications onto the cloud. 

### Anuvaad
`2016`

Rails application which takes a pseudo code as input and writes skeleton code for a given inputs/outputs which involves code that needs to read from STDIN and write to STDOUT. Pseudo code has to be written once, and the application will output skeleton code in 12 different languages(C,C++,Java,PHP,Python,Python3,C#,.NET,Swift,Ruby,Javascript,Objective-C).
